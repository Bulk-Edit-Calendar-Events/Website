              activities.</li>
            <li>Other one-time uses.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Please note that the examples provided above are illustrative and
            not intended to be exhaustive. For more details on how we use this
            information, please refer to the &quot;Use of Your Personal
            Data&quot; section.</p>
          <p>If We decide to collect additional categories of personal

            materially different, unrelated, or incompatible purposes, We will
            update this Privacy Policy.</p>
          <h3>Disclosure of Personal Information</h3>
          <p>We may use or disclose and may have used or disclosed in the last
            twelve (12) months the following categories of personal information
            for business or commercial purposes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Category A: Identifiers</li>
            <li>Category B: Personal information categories listed in the
              California Customer Records statute (Cal. Civ. Code §
              1798.80(e))</li>
            <li>Category D: Commercial information</li>
            <li>Category F: Internet or other similar network activity</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Please note that the categories listed above are those defined in
            the CCPA/CPRA. This does not mean that all examples of that category
            of personal information were in fact disclosed, but reflects our
            good faith belief to the best of our knowledge that some of that
            information from the applicable category may be and may have been
            disclosed.</p>
          <p>When We disclose personal information for a business purpose or a
            commercial purpose, We enter a contract that describes the purpose
            and requires the recipient to both keep that personal information
            confidential and not use it for any purpose except performing the
            contract.</p>
          <h3>Share of Personal Information</h3>
          <p>We may share, and have shared in the last twelve (12) months, Your
            personal information identified in the above categories with the
            following categories of third parties:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Service Providers</li>
            <li>Payment processors</li>
            <li>Our affiliates</li>
            <li>Our business partners</li>
            <li>Third party vendors to whom You or Your agents authorize Us to
              disclose Your personal information in connection with products or
              services We provide to You</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Sale of Personal Information</h3>
          <p>As defined in the CCPA/CPRA, &quot;sell&quot; and &quot;sale&quot;
            mean selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making
            available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in
            writing, or by electronic or other means, a Consumer's personal
            information by the Business to a third party for valuable
            consideration. This means that We may have received some kind of
            benefit in return for sharing personal information, but not
            necessarily a monetary benefit.</p>
          <p>We do not sell personal information as the term sell is commonly
            understood. We do allow Service Providers to use Your personal
            information for the business purposes described in Our Privacy
            Policy, for activities such as advertising, marketing, and
            analytics, and these may be deemed a sale under CCPA/CPRA.</p>
          <p>We may sell and may have sold in the last twelve (12) months the
            following categories of personal information:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Category A: Identifiers</li>
            <li>Category B: Personal information categories listed in the
              California Customer Records statute (Cal. Civ. Code §
              1798.80(e))</li>
            <li>Category D: Commercial information</li>
            <li>Category F: Internet or other similar network activity</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Please note that the categories listed above are those defined in
            the CCPA/CPRA. This does not mean that all examples of that category
            of personal information were in fact sold, but reflects our good
            faith belief to the best of Our knowledge that some of that
            information from the applicable category may be and may have been
            shared for value in return.</p>
          <h3>Sale of Personal Information of Minors Under 16 Years of Age</h3>
          <p>We do not sell the personal information of Consumers We actually
            know are less than 16 years of age, unless We receive affirmative
            authorization (the &quot;right to opt-in&quot;) from either the
            Consumer who is between 13 and 16 years of age, or the parent or
            guardian of a Consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers who
            opt-in to the sale of personal information may opt-out of future
            sales at any time. To exercise the right to opt-out, You (or Your
            authorized representative) may submit a request to Us by contacting
            Us.</p>
          <p>If You have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 (or
            16) has provided Us with personal information, please contact Us
            with sufficient detail to enable Us to delete that information.</p>
